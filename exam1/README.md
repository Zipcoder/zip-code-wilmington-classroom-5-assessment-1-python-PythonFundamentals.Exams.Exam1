## Exercise 1

Open the program called *converter.py*

* Remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstring.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest exam1.test_converter
```

## Exercise 2

Open the program called *evaluator.py*

* Remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstring.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests.

```

## Exercise 3 

[Leap years](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html) are years where an extra day is added to the end of 
the month of February.

Criteria to identify a leap year:
* The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
    * If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year; unless
        * The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

Open the program called *gregorian_cal_utils.py*

* Remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstring.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest exam1.test_gregorian_cal_utils
```

## Exercise 4

Open the program called *loopty_loop.py*

* Remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstring.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest exam1.test_loopty_loop
```

## Exercise 5

Open the program called *listies.py*

* Remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstring.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest exam1.test_listies
```

## Exercise 6

Open the program called *dictionaries.py*

* Remove the line containing the pass statement and implement the functionality described in the docstring.
* Run the unit tests to validate that the implementation passes unit tests. 

```
python3 -m unittest exam1.test_dictionaries
```
